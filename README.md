# Applied_DataScience_PythonProject

This project analyzes a bike rental dataset for BikeEase, a New York-based urban mobility company. Using Python, I built a full data analytics pipeline to clean, process, and visualize operational and user behavior trends.

✅ Key Features:

Cleaned and optimized raw rental data

Performed statistical analysis on temperature, visibility, and rental count

Standardized and scaled numerical features

Analyzed seasonal and hourly rental trends

Encoded categorical variables for machine learning readiness

Created visualizations: bar plots, line graphs, and more

📁 Outputs include:

cleaned_data.json

cleanednprocessed.csv

Rental_Bike_Data_Dummy.csv

Plots saved as images for reporting

🔧 Tools Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
